         <h3>Sassy Sasha Finds Love</h3>
         <p>Sasha is a sassy old lady, into chasing cats and racoons. She spends most of the day napping, chewing rope and standing in doorways. Nights are spent complaining that humans will only give me short walks and force me to eat pills that taste bad. But now she does these things with her new friend, Sammy. They connected due to their love of standing in doorways chewing rope. They are celebrating their 10 month anniversary this week. </p>

         <h3>Koru Kicks Loneliness For Good</h3>
         <p>Sometimes being a rescue dog is the best thing ever. Koru knew she was lucky to land a posh place in Portland. But she suffered with feelings of being incomplete. Humans can only provide so much companionship and sometimes you just need the company of another dog. Koru joined the site and less than 3 days later she meet Barkley. They connected over a dinner of cat poop and have been inseperable ever since. </p>
